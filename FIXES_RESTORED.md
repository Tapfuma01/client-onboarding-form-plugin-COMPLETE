# All Latest Fixes Restored

This document confirms that all three main issues have been fixed and restored:

## ✅ 1. Email Settings Save Issue - FIXED

**Problem**: Email settings were not saving properly due to nonce verification mismatch
**Solution**: Fixed the nonce verification in `class-admin.php`
- Changed from `check_admin_referer('cob_email_settings_nonce')` to `wp_verify_nonce($_POST['_wpnonce'], 'cob_email_settings_nonce')`
- Now matches the form field `wp_nonce_field('cob_email_settings_nonce')`
- Settings save correctly to the database

**File**: `includes/class-admin.php` - Line 213

## ✅ 2. Share Link Functionality - FIXED

**Problem**: Generated draft share links were not taking users to the form page
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive share link handling

### Backend Implementation:
- Added `template_redirect` hook in main plugin class
- `handle_share_token_redirect()` method catches share links
- `get_form_page_url()` method finds pages with form shortcode
- Automatic redirect to form page when visiting share links

### Frontend Implementation:
- JavaScript detects share token in URL
- AJAX request fetches shared draft data
- Form automatically loads with shared data
- URL cleanup after loading

**Files**: 
- `client-onboarding-form.php` - Lines 60, 125-175
- `assets/js/form-script.js` - `loadSharedDraft()` method

## ✅ 3. Form Button Logic - FIXED

**Problem**: Submit button was not properly controlled, continue button showed on last step
**Solution**: Implemented proper button visibility logic

### Button Behavior:
- **Step 1**: Continue button only
- **Steps 2-3**: Previous + Continue buttons  
- **Step 4**: Previous + Submit buttons only

### Implementation:
- `updateButtonVisibility()` method controls button display
- Called from `updateStepDisplay()` on every step change
- Proper form validation before proceeding
- Enhanced form submission handling

**Files**:
- `assets/js/form-script.js` - `updateButtonVisibility()` method (Lines 200-220)
- `assets/js/form-script.js` - `updateStepDisplay()` method updated

## 🔧 Additional Fixes Restored

### Deadlock Prevention:
- Enhanced `save_draft` method with retry logic
- Transaction management with START/COMMIT/ROLLBACK
- Fallback save methods when main method fails
- Table optimization and maintenance
- Lock detection and resolution

### Form Validation:
- Step-by-step validation
- Required field checking
- Visual error indicators
- Better user feedback

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Share Link Flow:
1. Admin generates share link → `?cob_share=token123`
2. Plugin catches URL with `template_redirect` hook
3. Finds form page and redirects: `form-page?cob_share=token123`
4. JavaScript loads shared draft data
5. Form populates with saved data
6. URL cleans up automatically

### Button Logic Flow:
1. User navigates between steps
2. `updateStepDisplay()` called on each step change
3. `updateButtonVisibility()` determines which buttons to show
4. Buttons update based on current step position
5. Form validation prevents proceeding with invalid data

### Email Settings Flow:
1. User fills out email settings form
2. Form submits with proper nonce field
3. `wp_verify_nonce()` validates the nonce
4. Settings are sanitized and saved to database
5. Success message displayed

All fixes are now properly implemented and the plugin should work as expected with full functionality restored.
